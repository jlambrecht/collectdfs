Application that exposes all of the collectd statistics as a filesystem (via FUSE).

Compilation is done through normal autoconf method (autogen.sh, configure, make).

Full usage is available using 'collectdfs --help', but typical usage is something like:

collectdfs -o collectd-address=/var/run/collectd-unixsock ./collectd_mnt
